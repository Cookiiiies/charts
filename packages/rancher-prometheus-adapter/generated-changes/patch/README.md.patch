 # Prometheus Adapter
 
-Installs the [Prometheus Adapter](https://github.com/DirectXMan12/k8s-prometheus-adapter) for the Custom Metrics API. Custom metrics are used in Kubernetes by [Horizontal Pod Autoscalers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/) to scale workloads based upon your own metric pulled from an external metrics provider like Prometheus. This chart complements the [metrics-server](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/metrics-server) chart that provides resource only metrics.

 ### Adapter Rules
 
-Additionally, the chart comes with a set of default rules out of the box but they may pull in too many metrics or not map them correctly for your needs. Therefore, it is recommended to populate `rules.custom` with a list of rules (see the [config document](https://github.com/DirectXMan12/k8s-prometheus-adapter/blob/master/docs/config.md) for the proper format).
